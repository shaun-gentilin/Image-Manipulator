# Image-Manipulator
This repository consists of interfaces, classes, and methods for manipulating images.
More specifically, this code has functionality to blur, sharpen, grayscale, and sepiotome images.
The code can also programically generate a checkerboard image that can then be used in the manipulation methods.
The code also provides a model interface, as well as an implementation of the interface, which allows the storage and manipulation of multiple images.  The user can add, remove, apply a manipulation, and get an image from the model.
